🔌 Circuit Solver using Python | Graph Theory, Cut Set & Tie Set, Laplace Analysis
This project is a Python-based Circuit Solver that analyzes electrical circuits using graph theory concepts, specifically the cut set and tie set methods. The solver computes voltages and currents at all nodes and branches, both in the Laplace (s-domain) and time domain, making it a powerful tool for transient analysis.

✨ Features
📐 Graph-Based Circuit Representation: Circuits are modeled as graphs, enabling systematic analysis using cut set and tie set matrices.

🔄 Laplace Transformation: Converts time-domain circuit elements and sources to the s-domain for easier analysis.

🧮 Symbolic Equation Formation: Forms and solves Laplace-domain equations for node voltages and branch currents.

⏱️ Inverse Laplace Transformation: Converts s-domain results back to time domain using symbolic math libraries.

📊 Time-Domain Plotting: Automatically plots voltages and currents over time for all nodes and branches.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python

SymPy (for symbolic math and Laplace transforms)

Matplotlib (for plotting time-domain results)
